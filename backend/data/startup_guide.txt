## Market Validation
Market validation is the process of determining whether your product or service solves a real problem for a large enough market. Start with customer interviews, surveys, and landing page tests before building your full product.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
An MVP is the simplest version of your product that can be released to early customers to collect feedback. Focus on core features that solve the primary problem. Avoid feature creep in the early stages.

## Customer Discovery
Talk to potential customers early and often. Understand their pain points, current solutions, and willingness to pay. Use tools like surveys, interviews, and social media to gather insights.
